# blog_romancing-japan

This blog app has been designed as a legitimate blog site to publish and promote articles written by the author of this site, which cover cultural topics related to the author's home of Japan. Next.js v13 was chosen because of its server-side rendering and use of the app directory architecture. The decision to use the Next.js framework was partly due to its layout design and the use of React components. However, ultimately I decided that server-side rendering would be required to include SEO metadata tags. The backend data is managed by sanity.io, which meant that I had to get used to the GROQ query language. I made the decision to use Sanity simply because I wanted to try it out. I wanted know if it would make my life easier... In some ways I think it has... Next time I will go back to Node.js.
